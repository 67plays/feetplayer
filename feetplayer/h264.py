"""H.264 video decoding, in Fortran, loaded through ctypes.

The decoder itself is in ``fortran/`` -- fixed-form FORTRAN 77, about seven
thousand lines of it, compiled by gfortran into a shared library that this
module loads and calls. Nothing here decodes anything; this is the part
that finds the library, converts between the two shapes an H.264 stream
comes in, and gets out of the way when the machine has no Fortran on it.

Where the library comes from depends on who is running. From a checkout it
is compiled on demand and cached in the temporary directory, keyed by the
sources and the compiler. In a packaged application there is no compiler,
so the packaging compiles it on the build machine and ships it inside this
package under the name ``prebuilt_name()`` -- see ``build_library``, which
is the one entry point all three packagers use.

Why Fortran: the arithmetic decoder in clause 9.3 is a serial dependency
chain -- one table lookup, one subtract, one compare, per *bit* -- and a
bitstream is millions of bits. Python does that at a few hundred thousand
bins a second, which is about four orders of magnitude short of a video.
Fortran does it at 120 million. The rest of the codec followed the
entropy layer across the boundary because splitting a decoder in half at
the macroblock level would mean marshalling every coefficient.

What decodes today: I, P and B slices, either entropy coder -- CABAC or
CAVLC -- 4:2:0 8-bit, Baseline, Main and High profile. Every intra
prediction mode, both transform sizes, scaling matrices, quarter-sample
motion compensation, explicit and implicit weighted prediction,
bi-prediction, both spatial and temporal direct prediction, up to four
reference frames, the deblocking filter. Not interlace, not SP or SI
slices, and not a B slice under CAVLC -- see the module docstring in
``fortran/h264api.f`` for the status codes each of those produces.

B slices decode in decode order, which is not presentation order. This
module hands back a picture per access unit and says nothing about when
it should be shown -- only what its picture order count is, through
``Decoder.poc``. Reordering is the container's business and lives in
``mediacodec``, which has the composition offsets to do it with.

The library holds one decoder's worth of state in COMMON blocks, which
is to say a single global one. ``_LOCK`` is what stops two ``<video>``
elements from interleaving their macroblocks; it is not an optimisation
to remove later, it is load-bearing.

Inter slices made that state persistent, which makes it sharper still: a
frame is now decoded against the pictures the previous calls left behind,
so a second ``Decoder`` touching the library does not merely slow the
first one down, it invalidates it. ``_owner`` tracks whose pictures are
in the buffer, and a decoder that finds it is not the owner replays its
own stream from the last IDR before decoding. In the ordinary case of one
video playing there is no replay and no copy.
